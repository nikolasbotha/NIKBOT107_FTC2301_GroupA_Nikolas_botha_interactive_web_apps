<!-- 
    why did this not work:
    - the scripts.js did not use the import function syntax. missing "import", .js , and {}
    - the configuration.js code did not declare or export the variable
    - source tag was incorrect in html file


    What changes do you need to make to achieve the intended behavior?:
    -use the correct syntax to implement modules in js that correctly share information with each other


    Are there any other ways in which it can be been solved?:
    one needn't use modules, the script tags could be called inline in the html 
    else, the script could be consolidated into one file

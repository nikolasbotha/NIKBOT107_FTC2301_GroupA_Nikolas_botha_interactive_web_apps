// Old code

// const value = "3"
// console.log(value + 4 + value)

//  the problem in the code is that the + function is not being used as a mathematical operator, it is being used to concatenate a string 
// by changing the variable to an integer it will perform a mathematical operation 

// new code:

const value = 3
console.log(value + 4 + value)
